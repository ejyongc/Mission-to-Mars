# Mission-to-Mars

In this analysis we have created a web appplication using *Flask*. This web application utilizes *BeautifulSoup* and *Splinter* to scrape specific data from a Mars website.  All this data will be stored on a Mongo database for it to be retreieved later by the *Scrape* function we have created in our website application.
